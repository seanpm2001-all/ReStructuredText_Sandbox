Project language file 1
==============

For Seanpm2001/LearnPython
-----------------

The first and main project language file for this project is ReStructuredText, as this project (Seanpm2001/ReStructuredText_Sandbox) solely uses ReStructuredText in a sandbox setting to learn about and experiment with the language.

This is an instance in which I am using ReStructuredText as a project language. If you want to do the same for your project, add this to your ``.gitattributes`` file

::

*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false

::

Advanced version:
-----------------

::

    # ReStructuredText (*.rst)
    *.rst linguist-detectable=true
    *.rst linguist-documentation=false

::
